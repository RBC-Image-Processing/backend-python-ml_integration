# Project Name: Machine Learning Model Training and API Deployment

## Overview

This project is designed to train machine learning models using modular components for preprocessing, model creation, training, and integration with Kaggle for remote training. Additionally, the project exposes a REST API to serve the trained model for predictions, enabling external systems to send data for inference.

### Modules

1. **`api/`**
   - **Purpose**: This module contains the code that defines the REST API endpoints using a framework like Flask or FastAPI. It serves the trained model and allows external systems to send data (such as images) for inference.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - Provides endpoints to make predictions with the trained model.
     - Facilitates communication between external systems and the trained model via HTTP.

2. **`config.py`**
   - **Purpose**: This file stores all project configuration settings. You can define global constants, environment variables, file paths, and other settings that are reused across the project.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - Centralizes configuration for easy management.
     - Helps with project scalability by separating configuration from code.

3. **`kaggle_integration/`**
   - **Purpose**: This module handles integration with Kaggle for remote training. It contains functions for pushing code to Kaggle kernels and retrieving results such as trained models.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - Pushes the training script to Kaggle notebooks.
     - Retrieves trained models and outputs from Kaggle after training.

4. **`main.py`**
   - **Purpose**: The main entry point for running the entire machine learning pipeline. It orchestrates preprocessing, model building, training, and integration with Kaggle.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - Executes the full pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and API serving.

5. **`model/`**
   - **Purpose**: This module defines the architecture of the machine learning model. It contains functions that create and configure the model architecture, such as neural networks or other ML algorithms.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - Constructs and returns the machine learning model.
     - Can include utilities for saving and loading model architectures.

6. **`models/`**
   - **Purpose**: A directory to store trained models after training. The models are retrieved from Kaggle or locally trained models can be saved here.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - Stores the trained model file (e.g., `.h5`, `.pkl`).
     - Acts as the directory from which the API loads the model for predictions.

7. **`preprocess/`**
   - **Purpose**: This module contains data preprocessing functions that are responsible for transforming raw data into the required format for model training. This may involve scaling, normalization, augmentation, or other preprocessing techniques.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - Cleans, processes, and prepares data for model training.
     - Ensures data is in the correct format and structure for the model.

8. **`scripts/`**
   - **Purpose**: Contains scripts and metadata required to push and execute the training process on Kaggle. For instance, the training script and `kernel-metadata.json` file live in this directory.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - Houses the training script that will be run in the Kaggle kernel.
     - Contains configuration files such as `kernel-metadata.json` for managing Kaggle kernel behavior.

9. **`test_main.http`**
   - **Purpose**: A test file used for making HTTP requests to the API endpoints. This file helps in testing the API endpoints without using external tools.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - Facilitates testing of API requests and responses directly from the development environment.
     - Allows simulation of requests that external systems might send for prediction.

10. **`train/`**
    - **Purpose**: Contains the code responsible for training the machine learning model. This module is where the training loop, evaluation, and optimization of the model are implemented.
    - **Key Functions**:
      - Manages model training with the processed data.
      - Handles model evaluation, checkpointing, and performance tracking.
